<summary><b>Private</b> and <b>public pins</b></summary>

Astrid and Brynhild are playing together, however Astrid has a tad too many mushroom pins for Brynhild's liking.
Thanks to **Better‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Cartography Table**, their friendship is safe, as Astrid can selectively decide which pins to share on the public cartography table.

Astrid and Brynhild are planning their next expedition.
Thanks to **Better‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Cartography Table**, they can collaborate in real time on the cartography table.

<summary><b>Guild pins</b></summary>

Thanks to **Better‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Cartography Table**, guilds can privately share pins amongst members.
Brynhild is a member of The Ground Shakers guild, and Astrid does not have access to their cartography table.
Astrid creates The Mushroom Enjoyers guild so that she can share a Super Secret Hideout with other mushroom enjoyers, which Brynhild will never know about.

## Features

- Pins are **private** by default, and can be individually shared on a **public cartography table**.
  - You can now safely go ham and pin all those nice berries / copper veins / whatever floats your boat, without worrying about cluttering another player's map.
- When multiple players are interacting with the same **cartography table**, changes are reflected in real time for all of them.
  - This allows collaborating over the map in real time, especially useful when planning the next expedition.
- **Cartography tables** can be **public** (default) or **restricted to a guild** (if [**Guilds**](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Smoothbrain/Guilds/) is installed).
  - For when you want to share super secret guild hideouts with your mates. Not that it ever happens. Definitely don't look for super secret guild hideouts on your servers. Nope...
- If using the `NoMap` world modifier, map will be accessible only through a cartography table.

## But why?

The vanilla **cartography table** is quirky and often leads to frustration on multiplayer servers: it only stores the pins of the last player that wrote to the table, completely replacing what was previously recorded.

This often results in situations where shared pins seem to disappear / reappear constantly when multiple players interact with the table on a regular basis (and it also never updates cross off status...).

On top of that, since the **cartography table** is "all or nothing" both ways, some players might refrain from interacting with the table (e.g. when someone is meticulously pinning all berries / copper veins / etc., or when they do not want to share some super secret pins they would prefer to keep private).

And of course, the vanilla cartography table is completely useless in `NoMap` runs.

## Vanilla cartography tables, but Better‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

The goal is to stick close to the vanilla experience and keep **cartography tables** relevant (or in the case of `NoMap` runs, give them a purpose). We are not bypassing **cartography tables**: sharing map data (both pins and exploration) still requires players to interact with the same **cartography table** on a regular basis to synchronize progress.

How it works:

- When interacting with a **cartography table**:
  - Synchronize map exploration (same as vanilla).
  - Retrieve **table pins** currently stored on the table.
  - Open the map:
    - **Private pins** can be interacted with, and can additionally be stored on the table, becoming **table pins** (either **public** or **guild pins**, depending on the table mode).
    - **Table pins** can be interacted with, and can additionally be unstored from the table, becoming **private** pins. If multiple players are currently interacting with the same **cartography table**, changes to **table pins** are reflected in real time for all of them.
- When opening the map without interacting with a **cartography table**:
  - **Private pins** can be interacted with.
  - **Public** or **guild pins** previously retrieved from a **cartography table** can be displayed / hidden, but cannot be interacted with.

**Table pins** are stored in a custom ZDO key under the **cartography table**'s ZNetView's ZDO, thus there is no conflict between non-modded vanilla clients and modded clients. Limited one-way compatibility is even provided, as modded clients will also write public pins to the vanilla shared data, allowing non-modded vanilla clients to receive public pins seamlessly. However non-modded vanilla clients will not be able to contribute anything: modded clients can only receive pins from other modded clients.

## Install

This is a client-side mod, it does not need to be installed on the server.

It is not strictly required for all clients on the server to install the mod, however non-modded vanilla clients will not be able to share any of their pins with modded clients, so of course it's better if all clients install it üòÖ
